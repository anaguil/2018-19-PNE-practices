Client-server model

program C = client
program S = server

Client does a request to the server (starts the communication), server responds . The server can respond many clients.
If there is no clients there is no problem. The server is there waiting.
But if there is a client and there is no server, we have a problem. Before creating the client we need to execute the server.

The programs run inside a computer, mobile phone, table.. There are other programs inside these computers apart from the client's or the server's.
You can execute in the same computer both programs, the client and the server.

The programs are connected by Internet. Internet is composed of many computers interconnected. They are connected in networks (separated in different groups).
IP address refers to the network interface so that one computer can have more than 1 IP addresses depending to what it is connected. (1 IP address for each connection)
The IP can change depending to which computer you connect.

My phone IP address at URJC is: 10.0.54.84
The IP address of my computer at the lab is: 212.128.253.80
Teacher's IP address: 212.128.253.64

Ping
It is a request to see if the connection works. You stop it by pressing ctr-C.
The ping command also informs you about the time it takes for the Ping message to reach the machine and return to your computer
* ping time to 8.8.8.8: time = 3.44 ms
* ping time to my computer: time = 0.065 ms (65 microseconds)
* ping time to a computer in te same network: time = 0.605 ms (605 microseconds)
* ping time to my mobile phone: time = 4.98 ms

URL: identifying a computer interface for humans. The URL has an IP address.
* ping to www.google.com: 216.58.211.228 (IP direction)
* ping to www.urjc.es: 212.128.240.50

Port: number that identifies the applications that are available to connect. One computer has 1 IP address and several ports (number of servers)
For indentifying app we use the pair (IP, port)

A socket is an object for communicating with the server
